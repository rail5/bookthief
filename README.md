# BookThief

BookThief prepares PDFs to be home-printed and home-bound in "pamphlet"-style.

    For those of us who prefer print over screens

## What is "pamphlet"-style printing?

When BookThief spits out a new/converted PDF, you simply print it at home, double-sided, and then fold the stack of papers in half. (And staple them, if you want)

Be sure to tell your printer to print double-sided by flipping along the *short edge* (Portrait)
